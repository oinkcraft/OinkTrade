[OinkTrade] - A trading GUI for players to trade with each other
Prefix Requirements - Brackets must be dark grey (&8), single color for the inside/other messages.
* This plugin is part of the factions overhaul, but can be used in towny.
* Technically all worlds based on how permissions are set up, but for Oinkcraft usage it'd be factions & towny.

Description:
This plugin will be for players to trade items/money in a fair way. The aim is for an inventory GUI to be created
and players will each have a side of the inventory. If they're in an unsafe location, they can still be hit/killed.
When the inventory is quit out of, the trade is cancelled. There will be options for money at the bottom and 
a accept/refuse trade. Players won't be able to talk while this is open, will require previous communication.
GUI should be the size of a normal double chest.

GUI Image and Description:

Iron Bars - Separating the players' available slots for putting in the items they wish to trade.
Glowstone & Coal - Sample items to trade
Grey Glass Panes - Can either a) say "Options", or b) Be used to keep track of money increments
Gold Nugget - Increase money by $100
Gold Bar - Increase money by $1000
Gold Block - Increase money by $10,000
Diamond - Increase money by $100,000
Light green pane - Confirm trade (Set a player to agreement)
Red pane - Refuse trade/cancel confirmation (in case the other player changes last second)
Red concrete - Exit out of trade inventory (feel free to use wool or something else red)
Blue concrete - Clear money count (in case of too much/misclick) (move all items back to player inv)
*Bottom row should be the same as the left side, the blue/red concrete on the bottom right should be flipped

Features Needed:
- The ability to request trades with other players through the /oinktrade command
    - Commands would be '/otrade <player>' and '/otrade <accept/refuse>'
    - Trade requests should time out after 20 seconds
    - Feel free to use /otrade as an alias, or /trade.
    - Person to initiate trade gets left side, person to accept gets right side
- When the request is sent/received, both players should be notified to be in a safe place as they might still be able to get hit (if PvP is enabled)
- **IMPORTANT** Players must be in the same world. This is incredibly important.
- In the trade GUI that opens up, players can place items from their inventory into their side of the GUI
    - Cancel the event if the inventory slot clicked isn't on their side
- Players should not be able to pick up items that are part of the GUI
    - So if it's an iron bar/that exact slot number, cancel the event
- Players can click the items on the bottom, as described above, and those will perform their actions
- For the money, allow a player to add however much they want.
    - When the trade is confirmed, just cancel the trade as you would if someone refused and tell them they put in too much money.
- When money is selected, find some way to count it while making that amount visible to the player.
    - Maybe use the blue concrete via name? Also used to clear it. Displaying that is up to the developer
- Players can NOT escape the inventory. They must use the red concrete/other red item.
    - When a player quits with the red concrete/other red item, move each player's respective items back to their inventories
    - I would recommend a method somewhere so this can be done with they take damage, quit the trade, not enough money, etc. E.g. 'doTrade()' 'cancelTrade()'
    - If a player is hit/takes damage, cancel the trade as well(^).

Commands:
- Base: /oinktrade
    - Aliases: /otrade, /trade
- Initiate Trade: /oinktrade <playername>
- Accept/Refuse Trade: /oinktrade <accept/refuse>
- Spy on a Trade: /oinktrade spy <playername> *This is ENTIRELY optional and to be done ONLY if the rest is complete. Not actually practical, just fun.
    - It essentially lets someone look at the inventory. Again, optional and to be done ONLY if the rest is complete.

Permissions:
- oinktrade.trade | Allows someone to send a trade. Not necessary to add another permission to accept trades, but if you really want it can be done.
- oinktrade.spy | Allows someone to spy on a trade. Again, OPTIONAL. It's not actually practical, just fun.
*These permissions will be added per-world
